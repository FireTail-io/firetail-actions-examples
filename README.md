# FireTail Actions
Actions refer to the automated tasks that can be performed on an API. You can create an action against an API, triggered by an event or schedule. When creating an action you can choose from the following integration types:
* Custom
* Mananged

The custom integetration option enables you select a previously created Lambda or Webhook integration, or create a new Lambda or Webhook integration. 

Learn more about Actions and how to set them up by visiting [FireTail's Actions documentation](www.firetail.io/docs/actions).
